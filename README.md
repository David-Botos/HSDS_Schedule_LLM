What you might find useful is in 01_training_data_generation/generate_training_data.py and 02_model_training/scripts.  

01_training_data_generation/generate_training_data.py is an example of how you might use BAML to help you execute the LLM as an annotator synthetic data generation technique.

02_model_training/05_train.py is poorly written, but shows off how you can use Modal + Unsloth for pretty cheap model training.

Let me know if you have any recommendations for improvement or tools / techniques you think would be useful
